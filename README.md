# Living-in-Happiness-Streamlit-App

A data science web application that analyses data from the infamous World Happiness Report. I wanted to continue honing my data analytic skills on Streamlit by practicing on the World Happiness Report database. This repository is a continuation of the lessons I learned in [Data Science Web App Guide](https://github.com/gianmillare/Data-Science-Web-App-Guide) from the highly recommended course [Build a Data Science Web App using Streamlit](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-science-streamlit-python/home/welcome).

At a high level overview, I visualize the constiuents of "happiness" across 153 countries. I look at things like top 10 happiness countries, the happiest regions, and the relationship between happiness and GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, and more.
